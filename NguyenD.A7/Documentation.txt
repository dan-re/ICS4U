Error at: Term class, isGreater() method
Nature of error: terms were compared by their coefficients, not by their exponents
Correction: make the computer compare two terms by their exponents first. Coefficients are only taken into account when the exponents are equal

Error at: Term class, evaluate() method
Nature of error: variable was multiplied by the coefficient before is was raised to the power of the exponent
Correction: move the coefficient outside of the Math.pow() function
